## 🌟 A Little About My Journey

Once an engineer curious about circuits and signals, now a data analyst decoding patterns hidden in millions of rows.

With over 4 years of experience transforming messy data into meaningful insights across **healthcare**, **banking**, and **pharma**, I’ve built predictive models that improve patient safety, automated pipelines that save hours of manual work, and dashboards that light up decision rooms.

I recently completed my **Master’s in Business Analytics** from the University of North Texas, and before that, I was engineering systems and solving problems at Capgemini and UnitedHealth Group.  

I believe data isn’t just numbers—it's **narrative**. And I’m here to tell great ones.

- 📊 Turning complex systems into **story-rich dashboards** (Power BI / Tableau)  
- 💬 Bridging the gap between **data, business, and compliance**  
- 🚀 Preparing for exciting opportunities to make data work *harder and smarter*
